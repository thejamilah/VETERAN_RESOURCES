# VETERAN_RESOURCES

## PROJECT HISTORY
This project began as a combination of a learning experience and a labor of love. The initial project was written entirely in Vanilla JavaScript as part of the learning processs. The development team consisted of a mix of Veterans, Non-Veterans and Family Members of Veterans. Veterans shared their experiences of transitioning from military to civilian service and Family Members of Veretans shared their experiences as well. Raw shared experiences flourished into something more than our team initially imagined. This drove Jamilah and James to move forward and expand this project.
 
### PURPOSE
As a Vet, family or community member, no matter what you may be experiencing, there is support for getting many, many Veterans the strength to reach out and make the connection in finding the Veteran resources most helpful.
